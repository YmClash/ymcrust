# Personal Rust Utils Library

## Overview

This library is a collection of personal utility functions and structures designed to enhance productivity and efficiency when working with Rust. It encapsulates common patterns, algorithms, and helpers that I find myself reusing across projects.

## Features Roadmap


- **Error Handling Utilities**: Simplify and streamline error handling in your Rust applications.
- **Data Structures**: Custom implementations of data structures for specific use cases.
- **Concurrency Helpers**: Tools and functions to make working with threads and async code more intuitive.
- **IO Operations**: Enhanced and simplified file and network IO operations.
- **Algorithm Implementations**: A collection of algorithm implementations, from sorting to searching and beyond.


## Getting Started

To use this library in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
personal_rust_utils = { git = "https://github.com/YmClash/personal_rust_utils.git" }
